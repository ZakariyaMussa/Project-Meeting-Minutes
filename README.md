# Project-Meeting-Minutes
The website Project Meeting Minutes was created by me as a contractor for hi-tech limited. This project's goal is to make it easier for meetings to keep minutes.
4. How can I set up a meeting minute account?
a. Go to our "Sign Up" page and enter your name, email address, password, and a password confirmation. A notification displaying either an error or a success prompt will appear at the top of your screen after you just submit.
5. How can I obtain the "Meeting Minute"?
Meeting minutes are still under construction and cannot be used regularly at this time. As a result, we anticipate its publication in the near future.
 If you want to erase a minute, click on the delete button next to it. You may also log out by clicking the logout button in the navbar at the top of your screen.
