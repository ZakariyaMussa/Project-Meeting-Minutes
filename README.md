# Project-Meeting-Minutes
The website Project Meeting Minutes was created by me as a contractor for hi-tech limited. This project's goal is to make it easier for meetings to keep minutes.
How can I set up a meeting minute account?
visit our Nav-bar and click "Sign Up" page and enter your name, email address, password, and a password confirmation.  After that, a prompt stating that the account has been established should appear at the top of the screen. Then, using the navigation bar, go to the sign-in page and log in using the details you provided when creating your account. 
How can I obtain the "Meeting Minute"?
 use the text field to enter the necessary information about your meeting, then click the "Create Minute" button at the bottom of the page to create a meeting. The information will thereafter be presented at the page's top from that point. 
 If you want to erase a minute, click on the delete button next to it.
